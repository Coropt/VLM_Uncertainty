### 2. Uncertainty Quantification via Reasoning

### 3. Tools and Frameworks

- [Fadeeva et al. (2023) — *LM-Polygraph: Uncertainty Estimation for Language Models*]  
  We used the **LM-Polygraph** framework in our experiments. It provides a unified Python interface and benchmark for state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods (information-based, ensemble-based, density-based, and black-box approaches). In this project, we leveraged their released codebase rather than reproducing all methodological details.
